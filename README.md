## Up Next
- First up would be the option to track other types of exercises like cardio or class workouts like yoga or spin.
- A timer for cardio and workouts, and maybe a run tracker.
- I would also like to add a social aspect where users can share their workouts and get ideas from other users.

## Issues
- chart x axis labels display id info of the database model.
- remove unused views and routes.
- desktop view is pretty boring.
